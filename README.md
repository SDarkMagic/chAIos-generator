## What is this project?
------------------------
This project is an amalgamation of different helper functions and utilities grouped together with the goal of allowing for a rapid and user friendly
experience while creating mods for Nintendo games that modify large portions of the game's text assets. A UI is a goal I have for this project,
however before I start on that I first want to clean up the underlying code by converting to a more object oriented style. Currently the tool is used
from the command line, and has a variety of options that can be used. These options have varying levels of detail for the help descriptions, and are
not all entirely functional.
